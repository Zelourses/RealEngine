# realEngine
Game engine that i realistically could create by myself(almost). I'll try to do that it will be capable of creating real-time 3D rendering applications.

## What this thing can do?
On this time, well...  
It's initial building stage, so you don't have big possibilities.  
You can: 
+ write logs
+ call event system

## Libraries
For now this engine is using:
+ [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
